# DCN-2023
In this repository there are the programs that I wrote as projects in the class of Data Communication Networks at Mississippi State University during my study abroad experience in Fall 2023

In this repository there are 3 folders each one containing a project I worked on while attending the class Data Communication Networks.

PA1 is a program that creates a communication between a server and a client through sockets. It is an example of socket programming

PA2 is a program that creates a communication between a server and a client through sockets. Inb this new implementation of the program previously written in PA1 now it is importatn to keep track of the packets sent so that if the packets are lost in the communication they will be resent. Indeed the program has been written in order to manage these types of data losses. We would run the program and make the server and the client communicate through an interface that could drop or not each packet with a certain probability (this program was an .exe given by the porofessor to us). Also the structure of the data packet were not of our choice but as written in the first line of code, it was already decided by the professor.

PA3 is a program that simulates the behaviour of three different algorithms used to find a free spot to send data: the first one is the Linear approach, then there is the Exponential and lastly the Loglog.
I plotted the results on a pdf and created a brief report to show what's happening with big workloads and which algorithms behaves best.
